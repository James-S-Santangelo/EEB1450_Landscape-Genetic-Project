# EEB1450: Landscape genetics project â€” Populations genetics in white clover (_Trifolium repens_) along urbanization gradients
### Author: James S. Santangelo

## Background

This repository contains code and data for a final project in landscape genetics at the University of Toronto. In this project, I use microsatellite markers genotpyed from replicate individuals in populations or _T. repens_ across 2 urban-rural transects to perform some basic population genetic analyses (e.g. testing for HWE among loci, assessing IBD, testing for genetic differentiation using and RDA).
